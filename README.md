# Implementation-and-Performance-evaluation-of-Horspool-and-Boyer-Moore-algorithms
1.	Horspool Algorithm
Implement the Horspool Algorithm, display the shift table contents and the starting indices of all the occurrences of the pattern in the text. Count the total number of comparisons involved.

2.	Boyer Moore Algorithm
Implement the Boyer Moore algorithm, display the good suffix shift table and the bad character shift table. Also print the starting indices of all the occurrences of the pattern in the text. Count the total number of comparisons involved.

3.	Performance Evaluation
Measure and compare execution times and number of comparisons for both algorithms and plot a graph to visualize their performance. (Hint: gnuplot can be used)

Two graphs to be plotted:
1.	Text length vs Execution Time for given test case against both algorithms
2.	Text length vs Number of comparisons for both algorithms 


Instructions:
1.	Boilerplate codes will handle the input, output and execution time calculation. 
2.	Input is available in input.txt
3.	Fill the code snippets in the TODO sections. The existing fprintf statements need NOT be touched. 
4.	The horspool_values.txt and boyermoore_values.txt files generated by the code can be used for plotting the graphs, sample graphs attached for reference (does not show the true relation between both algorithms).
